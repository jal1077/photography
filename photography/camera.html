				<div class="question">
					<h2 id="question1">What does photography mean to me?</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="answer">
					<p id="happy">Photography is my outlet of creativity. It helps me express myself. It is a choice of freedom of expression. To me, my camera means everything. It is like a mini time machine that I always carry around me. To enter the time machine, I only have to enter in my photos app and there I am, in any year that I want. It's my precious, prized possession.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="this">
				<div class="q2">
					<h3 id="question2">Why do I like photography? </h3>
					<p class="push"> I don't like photography; I love it. I see photography, specififcally my camera, as a what most can call a 'reality maker.' I make my own reality, the one that I can live in. The moments that I take and capture is up to me and no one else. And most importantly, photography allows me to explore. It makes me feel adventurous and want to know what is outside.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="q3">
					<h3 id="question3">What is the meaning of photos?</h3>
					<p class="push">The basic definition of photos is that it is an image that has been taken on a camera. But, most importantly, photos are open to interpretation. You see a picture and you as the viewer get the chance to create a story out of it. The ones that took the picture and are seeing it have the chance to relive the memory in their mind. Photos are portals to the past, and cameras are the only machine that allows you to have the ability to travel to the past.</p>

				<h2 id="question4">What else did I try doing besides photography?</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="q4">
				<div class="answer1">
					<p class="push" id="push1"> Besides being doing photography, I tried to become a vlogger. I wanted to create my own YouTube channel. But, to me, it wasn't the same. So I went back to taking pictures!</p>

				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="q5">
				<h2 id="question5">Future goals with photography</h2>
					<p class="push">I want to show my photos to people. I don't want to hobby a secret no more. This is my chance. I also want to take classes in photography. I am still an amaeteur photographer. I want to improve and perhaps even make it as a gig. All I know is that I want to continue to explore my hobby and bring it to different possibilities.</p>

			<div class="q6">
				<div class="answer2">
					<h3 id="question6">What are the main things that I take photos of?</h3>
					<div class="photos1">
						<p class="push">For the most part, I take pictures of nature and buildings. They are my muses to my art. Not complicated, just still and natural in their environment.</p>
