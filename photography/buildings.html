				<div class="yes">
					<p class="almost">When I take pictures outside, I notice the sky. For me, the sky can give a lot of character to a picture. And, in this picture, the sky fierce and prominent. It adds to the different elements in the pictures and accentuates the arc.</p>

				<div class="park">
					<p class="almost">My family and I went to Ringwood State Park. It was the first time we left our house to do something fun (obviously with our masks). The statue caught my eye. It was looking to its left, carrying grapes in its right hand. It was a statue that I wasn't expecting at the park, making me want to take a picture of it.</p>

				<div class="sign">
					<p class="almost">This was one of the pictures that I took for a class. The assignment was to take three pictures of something that would inspire you to write. A deli has a lot of charisma that most people can't see or ignore. The lighted ATM sign in the dark night attracted me and made me take a picture of it.</p>

				<div class="cars">
					<p class="almost">My friends and I were walking to Chinatown. I took this picture for the memory. I wanted a picture that reminded me of that day. And the sunset with the illuminated Chinese dragons in the background made the picture pop and caught my eye to have more reason to take the picture.</p>

			<div class="ending">
				<p id="end">These are a few of the pictures that really enjoyed taking. Photography, to me, is about having fun taking pictures. I wanted to show the pictures that make me happy when I look at them. Hopefully, it made you happy!</p>
