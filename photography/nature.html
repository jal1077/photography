					<p class="detail">I took this picture when it was a Kate Spade event in Gansevoort Market. That event was quick and fun; the weather was also perfect. Not too cold or too hot. I had so much fun with my friend. Since apples are my favorite fruit, I was attracted to take a picture of the apple tree.</p>

				<div class="rain2">
					<p class="detail">While walking to class, it was pouring hard. There was a big rainstorm that made the street look almost magical. The rain gracefully poured on the trees, and the street was peaceful. If only I took a short video of what I saw. The picture didn't do justice to the rainy scene.</p>

				<div class="nature2">
					<p class="detail">We were coming from the mountains, and we had to stop. The background was breathtaking. The sky looked incredible: mainly grey and blue but with wisps of white. The asphalt road was a great contrast to the green trees and vegetation.</p>
